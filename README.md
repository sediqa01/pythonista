## Features


### _Existing Features_

    ![NavBar](../pythonista/src/assets/readme/navbar-desktop.jpg)

    The navigation bar includes various clickable links, allowing the user to easily access the pages on the app. The links change according to whether the user is signed in or out, giving them access to more content once signed in.
    The links on the navbar are:

    * Pythonista Logo
    * Home
    * Create Post
    * Event
    * User Action (displayed as dropdown menu )
        * Profile
        * Sign Out
    * Sign Up
    * Sign In

   
    To make navigating easy for the user, the navigation bar is fixed, meaning it stays at the top of the page when the user scrolls down.

    The navigation bar displays in the same manner on all pages, ensuring uniformity across the app.

    A hover effect is incorporated, with the icons changing to a turquoise color and the cursor becoming a pointer on both the text and the icons, to help the user realize that the link is clickable.

    React Bootstrap was used to construct the navigation bar, which is fully responsive across devices.
